One application is all it takes to be considered for aid at the U of M and at any other schools you are considering. We strongly encourage every family to submit the FAFSA, even if they think they may not be eligible for aid. Regardless of your income level, the best resources for financial aid (University, state and federal aid) are only available through the FAFSA.</p>
<p>We use the FAFSA to determine your eligibility for federal, state, and University aid programs. A financial aid package might include grants, loans, scholarships, and/or work study. <strong>We encourage you to submit the FAFSA as soon as possible after it becomes available on October 1st of your senior year of high school.</strong></p>

<p>The FAFSA, available in both English and Spanish, is available <a href="https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa" target="_blank">online</a>. Be sure to release your information to the University of Minnesota Twin Cities by including the U of M Federal School Code of <strong>003969</strong>.</p>

<p>You may apply for aid before you receive an admission decision from the University of Minnesota. However, you won't learn what aid you've been awarded until you have been admitted.</p>

<p>If you are applying for financial aid for the 2021-22 year, you may use the IRS Data Retrieval tool, which will automatically fill in information for part of your FAFSA form. More information on the IRS Data Retrieval form is available <a href="https://studentaid.gov/resources/irs-drt-text" target="_blank">on the Federal Student Aid website</a>.</p>
