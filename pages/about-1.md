  - title: How long have you been doing Maths?
    content: Well Maths has been a vital part of my life since I was 3. I like to think that Mathematics exists in all kind of stories and objects we encounter in daily life. So I assume it is a vital part of *yours* life too!
  - title: Do I like anything else?
    content: <p> Well, yes, I do! It might be surprising (or not), but I'm a big fan of astronomy and cosmology, and I really love sharing about extraterrestrial life.</p> <p> So if you would like to read it, here's my blog <a href="https://planetariats.wordpress.com/"> Planetariats </a>.</p>  <p> I hope you like both sites as much as I do! </p>
  - title: This site is too childish! How can I find you on more advanced Maths site? 
    content: I'm glad you asked. Mathematic forums has been a vital parts of my Olympiad training. Currently I have an active account on AOPS and MSE. I mostly use AOPS to look up problems and search for materials, while I am a more active writer and member on MSE. You can find my questions and answers on my <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/users/756249/nikola-tolzsek"> MSE Profile - Nikola Tolzsek </a>

# About

Greetings,

My name is Dang Minh Trung. I am a senior at Hanoi-Amsterdam High school for Gifted students. Since my childhood, Mathematics has been an inseparable part of my life. Throughout my life, I have won the second prize in Vietnam National Mathematics Olympiad, and qualified for the Team Selection Test for IMO 2021. Besides this, I also won Gold medal at the HOMC 2018, and I am the valedictorian of the High school entrance exam to Mathematics Class of 2022. 

Even though I take great pride in my achievements, they are not the entire mathematical world for me. Rather, I love mathematics because of the diverse perspectives that a mathematical problem can be interpreted. Finding the core of the problem is what made my successes, yet is a challenge for many students in Vietnam. Therefore, I would like to dedicate this website, and all the games I coded on which, to help Vietnamese young students to have a better mathematical learning environment, where they can understand the root of the problems, and better informed of the mechanisms of difficult mathematical problems.

 I hope that you will have an enjoyable using my website. For any inquiry, please reach out to me at: trungdangminh14012004@gmail.com
