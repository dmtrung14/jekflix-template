# Math Inspiration Project
In early 2020, when the first COVID-19 waves hit Vietnam and put everyone on lockdown, a few students requested that I tutor them in Math. It struck me that most of them did not understand the underlying principles of problem solving, and was machininistically approaching math homeworks. This motivated me to start Math Inspiration, a personal, non-profit project that aims to create a logical and brainstorming playground for primary school students in my hometown. Starting from a small classroom at my house, we expanded to more than 80 students attending bi-weekly meetings where we had combinatorics games and learned scratch code. This website provides a collage to display our efforts and achievemnet through time.

All problems are listed in the collage chronologically, with English title and Vietnamese description for referral. Click on the tags to see problems by topics. We cover more than 10 key words, each of which corresponds to a problem type that orients brainstorming process!

## How to Use:
Visit [the website](https://dmtrung14.github.io/mathinspiration), and click on the problem you want to solve.
Inside, there will be ``accordions`` that cover the theory and the solution to the problem

The ``toggle fullscreen`` button will lead you to the full screen Scratch game.

## Deployment:

In order to deploy the website, you will need to have Jekyll installed on your computer. Jekyll is a very excellent static-web template builder. Full documentations on Jekyll can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/)

To install Jekyll, we need to download and install a `Ruby+Devkit` version from [RubyInstaller Downloads](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/). Use default options for installation.

After that, install Jekyll and Bundler using `cmd` by typing `gem install jekyll bundler`. Type `jekyll -v` to check the version of jekyll installed.

This website is also hosted using github website. On how to create a github website with jekyll, I find [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqFjuX4VZmU) exceptionally helpful, and I personally followed Mike's instruction when I first started blogging.

Briefly explained, you first have to go to your repository `Setting` on github, and change your `Page` settings to `Deploy from a branch`. (GitHub has made site deployment much easier recently), and configure the source in your `config.yml` file.
