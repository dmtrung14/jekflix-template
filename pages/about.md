# About

Greetings,

My name is Dang Minh Trung. I am a senior at Hanoi-Amsterdam High school for Gifted students. Since my childhood, Mathematics has been an inseparable part of my life. Throughout my life, I have won the second prize in Vietnam National Mathematics Olympiad, and qualified for the Team Selection Test for IMO 2021. Besides this, I also won Gold medal at the HOMC 2018, and I am the valedictorian of the High school entrance exam to Mathematics Class of 2022. 

Even though I take great pride in my achievements, they are not the entire mathematical world for me. Rather, I love mathematics because of the diverse perspectives that a mathematical problem can be interpreted. Finding the core of the problem is what made my successes, yet is a challenge for many students in Vietnam. Therefore, I would like to dedicate this website, and all the games I coded on which, to help Vietnamese young students to have a better mathematical learning environment, where they can understand the root of the problems, and better informed of the mechanisms of difficult mathematical problems.

 I hope that you will have an enjoyable experience using my website. For any inquiry, please reach out to me at: trungdangminh14012004@gmail.com
