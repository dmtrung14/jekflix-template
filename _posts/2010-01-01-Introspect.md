  - title: How to use
    content: <p> On each page, you will see a brief introduction of the topic, and neccessary formulas (if there is) at the FAQs on top of the page. Then scroll down, you shall see the Scratch game embedded directly to the site. </p> <br> Not sure how to use the game?<br> Don't worry, inside the game, find the instruction button on the top right corner of the game, you will see the full guide to all features of the game. 
  - title: Can I re-use the games?
    content: Totally! Look for the "Clone the games" button on the top right of the page and click on it. It will lead you to my Scratch repository, where you can find the code for all the embedded content on this website. Feel free clone the code down and apply them to illustrate any math problem you want. 
  - title: Do we accept submission?
    content: To ensure the uniformity of content on the page, we currently do not accept submissions. However, you can suggest problems and games by sending email to me either via email or Facebook. 
  - title: How long have you been doing Maths?
    content: Well Maths has been a vital part of my life since I was 3. I like to think that Mathematics exists in all kind of stories and objects we encounter in daily life. So I assume it is a vital part of *yours* life too!
  - title: Do I like anything else?
    content: Well, yes, I do! It might be surprising (or not), but I'm a big fan of astronomy and cosmology, and I really love sharing about extraterrestrial life. <br> So if you would like to read it, here's my blog <a href="https://planetariats.wordpress.com/"> Planetariats <a>. I hope you like both sites as much as I do!
  - title: This site is too childish! How can I find you on more advanced Maths site? 
    content: I'm glad you asked. Mathematic forums has been a vital parts of my Olympiad training. Currently I have an active account on AOPS and MSE. I mostly use AOPS to look up problems and search for materials, while I am a more active writer and member on MSE. You can find my questions and answers on my <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/users/756249/nikola-tolzsek"> MSE Profile - Nikola Tolzsek <a>
