  - title: General Theory
    content: <p> given the system of equation \[\begin{cases}a \times x + b\times y=c \\ \frac{x}{y}=d \end{cases}\], Denote the first equation as (1), and the second equation as (2). <p> Then from (2), we have \(x=\frac{d}{y}\). Swap \(x\) for \(\frac{d}{y}\) in (1), we have a quadratic equation of variable y. <p> Now if you are primary schooler and have not been able to solve quadratic equations, then the given \(d\) should also be rational and \(d=\frac{e}{f}\). <p> Then, in (1), swap \(x\) for \(ez\), \(y\) for \(fz\). We shall have an easy equation for variable \(z\). <p> Remember to find \(x\) and \(y\), don't stop after you find \(z\)!
