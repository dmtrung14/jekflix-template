  - title: How to use
    content: <p> On each page, you will see a brief introduction of the topic, and neccessary formulas (if there is) at the FAQs on top of the page. Then scroll down, you shall see the Scratch game embedded directly to the site. </p> <br> Not sure how to use the game? Don't worry, inside the game, find the instruction button on the top right corner of the game, you will see the full guide to all features of the game. 
  - title: What is the difficulty range of problems embedded on this project?
    content: <p> Elementary </p> <br> And by *elementary*, I didn't meant elementary school, but elementary *maths*. All of the mathematics problems here can be solved with simple reasoning, with solutions that even primary schoolers can understand. However, there are still problems that I didn't encounter much later than primary school, which often requires experience to figure out.  <br> Still, they are games, try them out! 
  - title: Can I re-use the games?
    content: Totally! Look for the "Clone the games" button on the top right of the page and click on it. It will lead you to my Scratch repository, where you can find the code for all the embedded content on this website. Feel free clone the code down and apply them to illustrate any math problem you want. 
  - title: Do we accept submission?
    content: To ensure the uniformity of content on the page, we currently do not accept submissions. However, you can suggest problems and games by sending email to me either via email or Facebook. 
  - title: Do you teach online classes?
    content: No, I don't. However, I have a *Theory* section at the beginning of each post. To view the *theory*, click on the button, and the content will drop down. When you practice, click on the button again to hide the *theory*.
  - title: Cannot toggle full screen?
    content: Yes, toggle full screen for Scratch seems to be unavailable on external web. Therefore, if you find it hard to read on Math Inspiration, I always embed a *Toggle full screen* button on top of each game. This should lead you to the fullscreen mode of the game.
  - title: This site is too childish! How can I find you on more advanced Maths site? 
    content: I'm glad you asked. Mathematic forums has been a vital parts of my Olympiad training. Currently I have an active account on AOPS and MSE. I mostly use AOPS to look up problems and search for materials, while I am a more active writer and member on MSE. You can find my questions and answers on my <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/users/756249/nikola-tolzsek"> MSE Profile - Nikola Tolzsek </a>
